# Predicting Confidence Boundaries

Thesis.ipynb is a copy of the code written for my final year thesis on predicting confidence boundaries

The paper the code is based upon by Laurence aitchison is found here: 

**A breif overview of the code:**
1. Simulates trials on a example subject
2. Uses neural networks to find the boundries that a subject has between giving different confidence levels as an answer
3. Uses trained neural network to predict the answers of a subject and compares the predictions to data using a test dataset

The conclusion was that using neural networks was an accurate and fast way of finding the confidence boundries of subjects, however the 
neural networks need a lot of data to train which may not be easy to attain in the real world
